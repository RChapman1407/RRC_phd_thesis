This folder contains matlab files with different model parameter calibrations of the three- and five- box AMOC model used in this Thesis. 

We include here;
FAMOUS A 1xCO2
FAMOUS B 1xCo2
FAMOUSB 2xCO2
HadGEM3LL
HadGEM3MM

All calibrations here do not include the Mediterranean sea in the considered part of the Atlantic ocean, since the flow of water throught the strai of Gibraltar is approximated to be <10% the strength of the AMOC and thereforw would not have a significant impact.
These files include the model parameters given in Appendix D, before any optimisation of further parameters.
