A collection of Matlab scripts

HadGEM3MM_MC_tipping_plot_300_years.m
This produces Figure 5.10, Chapter 5. Example realsiation plot of some of the runs from the Monte Carlo experiment to caluclate tipping probabilities

HadGEM3_GC31_MM_noise_FnFsFt_estimation_decadal.m
This file does the noise estimation and parameter optimisation using a loglikelihood for HadGEM3MM as discussed in Chapter 5.

Plot_Salinity_Temperature_timeseries_RRC_copy.m
Produces Figure 4.3, plot of the CMIP6 salinity and temperature timeseries (extracted from HadGEM3 and via JASMIN), plotted as anomolies from the mean

fivebox_hosing_experiment.m
Produces Figure 3.6, hosing experiment using 5 boxes. The same code could also be used to produced Figure 3.5b. This also forms the base of the code for Figure 3.10, 3.11, 3.12

hosingfunc.m
Matlab function script used to implement the forcing profile described in Section 3.2, Figure 3.3 and Equation 3.2.3

loglikelihood implementation.txt
Explains the implementation of the loglieklihood method used in Chapter 5 and Appendix C in a pseudo-code. Can be used to help futher understand HadGEM3_GC31_MM_noise_FnFsFt_estimation_decadal.m above

plot_Threeboxbif_HadGEM3MM_PHASEPORTRAIT.m
Produces Figure 3.8. Phase portrait for HadGEM3MM calibration of 3-box model at H = 0.1 Sv (in bi-stable regime)
